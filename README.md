# Healthcare ETL Pipeline with Diabetes Prediction (AI)

## Project Overview
This project presents a complete **ETL pipeline** for medical data and a **machine learning model** for diabetes prediction.  
It is designed as an **educational and portfolio project** for a junior data engineer in the healthcare domain.

The project uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** and focuses on data quality, reproducibility, and clear documentation.

---

## Project Goals
- Build an end-to-end ETL pipeline using Python and pandas
- Clean and validate medical data
- Perform feature engineering and data transformation
- Train and evaluate a machine learning model for diabetes prediction
- Visualize results and model performance
- Follow data engineering best practices

---

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle – Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset
- **Type:** Tabular medical data
- **Target variable:** `Outcome` (0 = no diabetes, 1 = diabetes)
